Modify the existing Android React Native calculator vault chat app to behave like a modern Google calculator where calculation results are previewed live while typing without pressing the equals button, and only shown in large final text when the equals button is pressed. Restructure the calculator logic so live preview updates continuously and equals acts only as a finalization trigger. Fix the clear chat functionality so it permanently deletes messages from the server using the existing HTTPS messaging API instead of temporarily hiding messages for two seconds and reappearing; clearing chat must remove messages server side and locally with no visual glitch. Implement a new secure pairing system fully controlled by the server where 4 digit pairing codes are generated via an HTTP request, stored server side in JSON with a strict 7 minute expiry, and associated with the requesting device ID. On first successful unlock using the default code 1234, prompt the user to either generate a new pairing code or enter an existing 4 digit pairing code. If generate is selected, request the server to create and store a pairing code and cache it securely on the device. If enter pairing code is selected, navigate to a new screen to input the 4 digit code, then request SERVER_URL/api to validate the code, update the pairing JSON to attach the second user as the companion for that code, and lock both users permanently to each other. Preserve the existing HTTPS messaging API for chat communication after pairing is complete. Implement ultra smooth iOS like animations and transitions across calculator, pairing, and chat screens with high frame rate UX polish. Add a retry on internet unavailable mechanism for all network calls with graceful UI feedback. Enforce strict stealth behavior where the secret chat screen immediately closes and locks when the exit button is pressed once, when the home button is pressed, or when the device side power button is pressed, without delay or animation leaks. Ensure all logic is cleanly structured, commented, production ready, and optimized for APK release.
